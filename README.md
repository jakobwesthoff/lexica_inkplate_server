# StableDiffusion (Lexica) powered ePaper

## About

This repository contains all the files needed, to setup an AcEP 7-color ePaper
to display random AI (StableDiffusion) generated images, which are fetched from
[Lexica](lexica.art).

The system contains a server component, which can be run on a raspberry pi for
example and a client component, which is run on an ESP32 microcontroler. This
differentiation has been made, to allow the client to be as energy efficient as
possible, as it will most likely be powered by battery.
